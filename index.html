      <h2> Artificial intelligence will reshape the business strategies</h2>
      <h5> {Business Transforms into a Ghostryder}</h5>
      <p><article>AI brings enormous changes to business operations, reshaping entire industries with the power of advanced technologies and software. Some companies now acknowledge the value of implementing the AI strategies for their business, and a major leap towards AI is on the way. Large companies with over 100,000 employees are more likely to implement the AI strategies, but for them, this process can be especially challenging. 2018 will be the year when the leading firms will incorporate AI applications into their strategic and organizational development. Additionally, there is a potential for algorithms marketplaces, where the best solutions created by engineers or companies can be shared, bought, and deployed for organizations’ individual use.

Brave ideas that used to be hard to believe, are becoming real. The constant development of machine learning and AI technologies will make every business.</article></p>

      <h2>Deep learning will be faster and data collection better2</h2>
      <h5>{Deep into the Abyss of Data}</h5>
      <p><article>Nowadays, deep learning faces certain challenges associated with the data collection and the complexity of the computations. Innovations in hardware are now being developed to speed up the deep learning experiments, e.g. the new GPUs with a greater number of cores and a different form of architecture. According to Marc Edgar, a Senior Information Scientist at the GE Research, deep training will shorten the development time of software solutions from several months to several days within the next 3-5 years. This will improve the functional characteristics, increase productivity, and reduce product costs.</article>

Currently, most large firms realize the importance of data collection and its influence on the business effectiveness. In the coming year, companies will start using even more data, and the success will depend on the ability to combine the disparate data.</p>

      <h2>The Internet of Things will become intelligent</h2>
      <h5> {This might just be the Thing of <strong>Everything</strong>}</h5>      
      <p><article>The intelligent things are everyday devices capable of smarter interactions with people and the environment. These things operate either semi-autonomously or autonomously in uncontrolled real-world conditions without the need for human intervention.

Intelligent things have been in a spotlight for several years, and with a continuous expansion and enhancement in 2018 they will influence another global trend — the Internet of Things.

A network of collaborative intelligent things will be created where multiple devices will work together developing IoT to its full potential. Connected to the global web and combined via wired and wireless communication channels, things will turn into a one big integrated system driving a major shift in the human-machine interaction. The fusion of artificial intelligence with the Internet of things brings about new amazing technologies to create smart homes and cities.</article></p>

      <h3> The Final (Fantasy) Frontier</h3>
      <h6><strong>{Fantasy becomes reality}</strong></h6>
<p><article>Space may not be the final frontier as we thought. Technology is a frontier on its own, continuing to evolve, grow and reshape our world. As we continue to explore and expand technology, the more life will change, creating new habits and forming new ways of working together.

While the future is unknown, we believe in leveraging technology to create personalized approaches and solutions.</article></p>
